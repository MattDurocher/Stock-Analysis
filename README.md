## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to find out if stocks were worth investing in or not for Steve. We looked at stocks from the years of 2017 and 2018 using code in VBA that pulled data from multiple dates for the 11 stocks. This data had points from from multiple days for each stock in a given year in order to give us an accurate read on how the stock did year over year. This was then outputted into a table thanks to the VBA code.
